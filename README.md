### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on projects as part of the Future Skills Academy VR and AR Applications training program with my team.
ðŸ”­ I completed one of my internships in unmanned aerial vehicles and the other in a company working on virtual reality and augmented reality.
ðŸŒ± I completed my thesis on search and rescue with swarm drones in a virtual environment. I worked with Gazebo Virtual Environment, ROS (Robotic Operating System), and Ardupilot SITL programs. I started my 3D modeling journey with Blender, creating character and object models, adding motion to models, creating animations, and performing target detection and tracking operations. Then, I moved on to Maya for facial modeling. Currently, I'm developing game projects with Unity. My goal is to transfer the models I design to the projects I will prepare and work on AR-VR projects.
ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in Julia, R, and Python and try to keep up with the latest developments. I developed projects in image processing and data analysis. I love working with large data sets. Machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence are areas that interest me. I started using PowerBI and Tableau tools in this area. I will soon do great work in this area as well.
