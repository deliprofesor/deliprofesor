### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
deliprofesor/deliprofesor** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on projects as part of the Future Skills Academy VR and AR Applications training program with my team.
ðŸ”­ I completed one of my internships in unmanned aerial vehicles and the other in a company working on virtual reality and augmented reality.
ðŸŒ± I completed my thesis on search and rescue with swarm drones in a virtual environment. I worked with Gazebo Virtual Environment, ROS (Robotic Operating System), and Ardupilot SITL programs. I started my 3D modeling journey with Blender, creating character and object models, adding motion to models, creating animations, and performing target detection and tracking operations. Then, I moved on to Maya for facial modeling. Currently, I'm developing game projects with Unity. My goal is to transfer the models I design to the projects I will prepare and work on AR-VR projects.
ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in Julia, R, and Python and try to keep up with the latest developments. I developed projects in image processing and data analysis. I love working with large data sets. Machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence are areas that interest me. I started using PowerBI and Tableau tools in this area. I will soon do great work in this area as well.
ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on open-source VR and AR projects, especially those that promote accessibility and inclusivity.
ðŸ’¬ You can ask me about 3D modeling, ROS, image processing, autonomous flight, and data analysis topics.
ðŸ“« You can reach me via GitHub messages or email at ilknurylmz.1707@gmail.com.

âš¡ Fun fact: Although I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering, my passion has always been software development. I work with joy, and I'm never regretful of staying awake for nights solving code errors. My mind is always on the projects I want to do :) I'm sure that even after 40 or 50 years, I will still be a software developer working with full energy in my field.
